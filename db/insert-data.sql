The winner was Jasmin Bauomy, a talented creative from Egypt but living in Germany with a background in journalism, podcasting, and blogging, and a passion for photography. We were finally able to deliver the trip in 2022, with me on board as mentor – but unfortunately, without Jasmin. She tested positive for COVID the day before she was supposed to fly.
Isaac (World Nomad’s Social & Content Marketing Manager and trip producer) and I were already in Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia when we got the news Jasmin couldn’t travel, so we went ahead with the trip as a photography assignment. Isaac acted as producer on the trip, handling a lot of the logistics. Our Discover Mongolia guide was Munkhbold. He was very enthusiastic, quite experienced, and he’s quite educated as well – he’s a teacher and very keen on archaeology and anthropology.
Our ten-day trip was divided into three parts, largely focused around the Naadam festival, which happens in July each year. From Ulaanbaatar, we headed south to the Gobi Desert, then north-central to a the regional town of Kharkhorin, and then back to Ulaanbaatar. So, one of the features of the trip was the long drives.
We went to three destinations in the Gobi Desert. The first was Tsagaan Suvarga, more commonly known as the White Stupa. These are white sand hills streaked with minerals, and white sand cliffs that run for about 400m (1,321ft).'),

Sunday was my final day in Lisbon – a city peppered with stairs and hills and all types of quad killers – and I was butt-burning, calf-stinging, omigod-call-me-a-taxi kind of sore. I’d also been training for a marathon – that would make any person sore. But this was different. My legs were supposed to be running 17 miles the next morning, and now, they could barely bend enough to let me sit down on the bank of the Tagus River.
That’s where I was, sitting alongside Portugal’s longest river and mapping out tomorrow’s run, when I spotted the statue – a massive wedge of stone, carved to resemble the bow and sails of a ship and depicting a queue of men looking ahead, toting maps and telescopes. Padrão dos Descobrimentos, I read. Monument of the Discoveries. People flocked around it, posing in front of Henry the Navigator and Vasco da Gama.
These age-old explorers still capture the imagination of their country today. I was surprised by how many Portuguese I spoke to mentioned them in casual conversation. Earlier, a bellhop told me that Vasco da Gama “wasn’t afraid of anything”, and suggested I channel him during my run.
I turned back to my map, sketching out my route. Start there, Cabo da Roca, I traced. Weave through that village there, Azóia, and into the Sintra forest. Then back towards Cabo da Roca again.

I folded my map, the one tool I shared in common with the great explorers. If they could do it, so could I.'),

         ('Learn how to avoid an avalanche and how to survive if you do get caught in one. Nomad Bill shares his experience taking an avalanche safety course.
There’s a certain majesty – and terror – in looking up at steep, snow-covered mountain peaks, even in the confines of a patrolled ski resort like Lake Tahoe’s Kirkwood. “You know, the thing about the ski runs here is that only 20% are man-made gaps from trees we cut down. The rest were created by avalanche paths through the forest.” says Andrew DeGuzman, backcountry guide and instructor at Expedition Kirkwood. It’s enough to make you want to enroll in one of their Avalanche Safety classes, as I did, even if not planning to head to the backcountry.

During the 2021 winter season, avalanches killed 37 people across the US – and not just backcountry skiers. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center reported snowmobilers, hikers, climbers, and snowshoers accounted for nearly half the total fatalities, the largest number in over a decade. In the words of the avalanche training manual, “Nature is notorious for keeping quiet most of the time and providing unforgiving feedback when you want it least.” So, no matter what your outdoor winter activity, it’s a good idea to at least brush up on some snow safety essentials in a class like Kirkwood’s AIARE Rec Level 1 course.

AIARE, the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education, is an organization that develops and supplies training programs to more than 100 different course-providers across the U.S., for both recreational and professional customers. The REC Level 1 class about avalanche safety basics is tailored for skiers and snowboarders, but relevant for anyone who may explore in snowy, mountainous terrain. It can be followed with further AIARE courses on snow science, avalanche rescue, and backcountry guiding.

Trail running shoes
Trail running shoes are the versatile all-stars of the footwear world. Whether you''re tackling rocky paths, muddy tracks, or forest floors, these travel shoes are designed to handle it all.

Hiking boots
When it comes to hiking, not all trails are created equal. Depending on where you’re going hiking, you may or may not need hiking boots.

Walking sandals
Walking sandals are your best friends for casual strolls, city tours, and light hikes. Based on my experience, they''re ideal for warm climates where breathability and comfort take precedence over heavy-duty support.'),

Because of numerous factors, but mostly my work situation (I never know if I will be insanely busy or bored one month to the next), I am turning 45 and still have never made it to Southeast Asia and in fact had to cancel a booked trip 4 times in the past (1 because of COVID, 1 because of family emergency, but 2 because of work).

However, the two times of year that work is consistently dead for me is May/June (which will be way too hot and humid for my temperament) or late December and early January, so much so that I could even swing 4 weeks off instead of 3.

Does anyone have advice/concerns about travelling during this time? I understand it may be pretty busy and more expensive, and means some options won''t be open for me (no green or yellow rice paddies), but have others found it too much of an insane hassle to deal with?

This covers all forms of currency, not only US dollars and not only cash. Failing to do so is a serious violation and can result in the seizure and forfeiture of your money. Criminal penalties can also apply." and then upon researching further into that, I''m not sure whether it is requiring me to bring at least $10,000 USD ($15,300 AUD) as the minimum? or that I need to declare somewhere stating that I''m going to be bringing in that amount of cash to the US.'),

         ('Hi everyone! First post and first time on this site so hopefully I’m posting in the right place.

Super excited to be here though! My partner and I love Europe and have backpacked across with a particular love of Italy. We found this easy to do with trains and the bag on our back and are now expanding to do a big trip across the US.. slightly due to turning 30 and still having such a long list of adventures I’d like to do (most recently having a desire to swim under a waterfall and experiencing some spectacular sites).

We have worked on our route and are very happy with it, allowing for a hearty 2 month trip to cover 5k miles- starting in San Fran, dipping down to Death Valley, up through Vegas and Utah and crossing Colorado and Dallas to get to New Orleans and then will be making our way up through Tennessee and over to Virginia & NY. That’s just a small nutshell version, will get to full details some other time

We will probably coachsurf and take a tent and utilise a car to keep it kind of cost effective but the biggest area of concern at the moment is the car situation. I’ve done an awful lot of research on the best ones to hire but they are all around 3k for just under two months. Can anyone give any suggestions? We hoped that a smaller car such as a sedan would be cost effective and we will still be comfortable as we are quite short in height luckily
But yes, car hire suggestions are so welcome and any advice too. RV or mini van would be cool but I imagine it’ll cost an awful lot. Thanks in advance'),

A lot of times we like to look into our crystal ball and think of all the things that will change in the coming years. Flying cars, levitating skateboards and so on. The future feels as uncertain as ever to me, so there are plenty of wildly different ways things could develop.

But here''s the different perspective - maybe we should be spending more time looking at what won''t change in the future.

Looking back over the last 21 years since Travellerspoint started, I can definitely see that travel has changed quite considerably. With access to smartphones, everything has become easier. Information is much easier to find. Connectivity is easier when you travel. While I sometimes wonder whether that''s even a good thing, there is no arguing that it''s vastly different than it was back then. But some things also haven''t changed. We still seem to all have the same itch to explore the world for example.

My challenge to you all is to do a little future gazing and let me know what you think will not change in the coming 20 years!'),

Are these the right towns to try to see?
How much time in each? (Bearing in mind we''re not keen on going inside museums, churches, etc)
It looks like T-M and Sighisoara are an hour apart by bus. Should we stay in one (which one) and bus it to the other for a day trip?

At this moment, the Deer and the Robin traverse the lower landscapes in search of sustenance, while higher grounds pose a challenging scarcity. As the days grow shorter, there is a yearning for the solace of nightfall, a time to "coorie in," snuggling close with family and loved ones.

The winter solstice arrives, bringing a sense of hope for new beginnings, as the promise of longer days emerges. The long night skies, draped in velvet blackness, are adorned with a sprinkling of stars. A December full moon, whether cold or prolonged, captivates as it lingers nearby.

In Scotland, where dark sky areas prevail, low light pollution reveals breathtaking sights—a canvas of ink-black skies adorned with dazzling stars. Galloway Forest Park proudly holds the distinction of being the first Dark Sky Park in the entire UK.
